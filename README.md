# Stock Sentiment Analysis

The purpose of this repository is to extract the sentiment of a financial news article talking about a specified, target stock. A score is calculated for the desired stock, with a score of -1 corresponding to strongly negative sentiment and a score of 1 corresponding to a strongly positive sentiment.

The next steps of this project are going to involve building a webscraper to find URLs as inputs to the sentiment analysis, rather than requiring manually feeding one at a time. Additionally, the "present" date will be an input, to allow for analysis of past trends.
